  abstract = {En el campo de la medicina, el aprendizaje autom\'atico se erige como una herramienta poderosa y eficaz en la automatizaci\'on de la tarea del diagn\'ostico por imagen, mediante la creaci\'on de modelos inform\'aticos predictivos. Para lograr resultados con un alto grado de fiabilidad, dichos modelos requieren de grandes vol\'umenes de datos para su aprendizaje, caracter\'istica poco frecuente en contextos reales, pues organismos e instituciones m\'edicas, individualmente, no suelen disponer de tales cantidades de informaci\'on. Idealmente, \'esta podr\'ia ser compartida y cedida mutuamente en busca de un fin com\'un, pero esto resulta altamente improbable, dadas las regulaciones imperantes en la actualidad en torno a la propiedad intelectual y la privacidad de datos m\'edicos de pacientes. A fin de superar tales escollos, surge el paradigma del aprendizaje federado (federated learning). En este Trabajo Fin de Master, aplicamos dicho paradigma en un caso de aplicaci\'on concreto (detecci\'on de tumores mamarios en im\'agenes de ultrasonidos), empleando tecnolog\'ia y t\'ecnicas espec\'ificas de federaci\'on (la librer\'ia TensorFlow Federated; la agregaci\'on federada est\'andar, Federated Average, y variantes de la misma), con las que entrenamos modelos predictivos sobre diferentes combinaciones de datasets. Evaluaremos la idoneidad y eficacia de dichos modelos federados, tanto por s\'i mismos como en comparaci\'on con resultados an\'alogos derivados de un aprendizaje cl\'asico. Exponemos que el aprendizaje federado puede alcanzar, bajo ciertas configuraciones, cotas de eficacia similares a las de un aprendizaje cl\'asico. El presente documento se articula, primero, con la introducci\'on de los conceptos clave tocantes al propio caso de estudio: el problema a resolver en cuesti\'on (segmentaci\'on de im\'agenes de ultrasonido), los aspectos concretos del aprendizaje autom\'atico que han ayudado a resolverlo (modelo de aprendizaje profundo, una red neuronal convolutiva U-Net) y profundizaremos en los fundamentos del paradigma de aprendizaje federado. Posteriormente, se detallar\'a la metodolog\'ia aplicada durante el desarrollo del proyecto y se expondr\'an los resultados derivados del mismo. Finalmente, abordaremos las conclusiones de dichos resultados, as\'i como las limitaciones y posibles mejoras en el \'ambito del presente trabajo y del aprendizaje federado, en particular.},

  abstract = {There is a great interest in automating White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) segmentation due to their importance in the medical eld as well as the great amount of inter- and intra-observer variability that appears when it is manually segmented in magnetic resonance imaging. In this work we present a multistep tailored preprocessing consisting mainly of brain extraction, intensity contrast enhancement, subject based slice cropping and intensity standardization. The segmentation task is then performed by a fully convolutional neural network with attention gates which employs a customized loss function based on the dice similarity coecient and the F1 score. Experimental results on the white matter hyperintensities segmentation challenge [Kuijf et al., 2019] show that our proposed preprocessing improves segmentation, that attention gated U-Net further improves segmentation tasks compared to the original U-Net and our proposed loss function has the potential to improve lesion-wise F1 on DSC based segmentations.},

In this paper we analyze the influence of preprocessing stages of the input data on a fully convolutional network (FCNN) based on the U-NET architecture.

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning augments the reinforcement learning framework and utilizes the powerful representation of deep neural networks. Recent works have demonstrated the remarkable successes of deep reinforcement learning in various domains including finance, medicine, healthcare, video games, robotics, and computer vision. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and state-of-the-art research advances of deep reinforcement learning in computer vision. We start with comprehending the theories of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning. We then propose a categorization of deep reinforcement learning methodologies and discuss their advantages and limitations. In particular, we divide deep reinforcement learning into seven main categories according to their applications in computer vision, i.e. (i)landmark localization (ii) object detection; (iii) object tracking; (iv) registration on both 2D image and 3D image volumetric data (v) image segmentation; (vi) videos analysis; and (vii) other applications. Each of these categories is further analyzed with reinforcement learning techniques, network design, and performance. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing publicly available datasets and examine source code availability. Finally, we present some open issues and discuss future research directions on deep reinforcement learning in computer vision},

  abstract = {Brain white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are linked to increased risk of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases among the elderly. Consequently, detection and characterization of WMHs are of significant clinical importance. We propose a novel approach for WMH segmentation from multi-contrast MRI where both voxel-based and lesion-based information are used to improve overall performance in both volume-oriented and object-oriented metrics. Our segmentation method (AMOS-2D) consists of four stages following a "generate-and-test" approach: pre-processing, Gaussian white matter (WM) modelling, hierarchical multi-threshold WMH segmentation and object-based WMH filtering using support vector machines. Data from 28 subjects was used in this study covering a wide range of lesion loads. Volumetric T1-weighted images and 2D fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were used as basis for the WM model and lesion masks defined manually in each subject by experts were used for training and evaluating the proposed method. The method obtained an average agreement (in terms of the Dice similarity coefficient, DSC) with experts equivalent to inter-expert agreement both in terms of WMH number (DSC~=~0.637 vs. 0.651) and volume (DSC~=~0.743 vs. 0.781). It allowed higher accuracy in detecting WMH compared to alternative methods tested and was further found to be insensitive to WMH lesion burden. Good agreement with expert annotations combined with stable performance largely independent of lesion burden suggests that AMOS-2D will be a valuable tool for fully automated WMH segmentation in patients with cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative pathologies.},

We propose a rotation invariant metric capable of distinguishing real and generated images and prove its performance and correlation with subjective evaluation on a brain MRI dataset to generate synthetic white matter lesion images. We name this metric CSD (Circular Spectrum Distance) due to its circular nature and its inherent relation to the Fourier Spectrum. We find that this metric, as opposed to Frechet Inception Distance or Inception Score, detects overfitting during training in terms of generator memorisation without making use of any pretrained network. The conclusions are generalized to CelebA-HQ as a benchmark dataset.},

  abstract = {Image segmentation technology has made a remarkable effect in medical image analysis and processing, which is used to help physicians get a more accurate diagnosis. Manual segmentation of the medical image requires a lot of effort by professionals, which is also a subjective task. Therefore, developing an advanced segmentation method is an essential demand. We propose an end-to-end segmentation method for medical images, which mimics physicians delineating a region of interest (ROI) on the medical image in a multi-step manner. This multi-step operation improves the performance from a coarse result to a fine result progressively. In this paper, the segmentation process is formulated as a Markov decision process and solved by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which trains an agent for segmenting ROI in images. The agent performs a serial action to delineate the ROI. We define the action as a set of continuous parameters. Then, we adopted a DRL algorithm called deep deterministic policy gradient to learn the segmentation model in continuous action space. The experimental result shows that the proposed method has 7.24\% improved to the state-of-the-art method on three prostate MR data sets and has 3.52\% improved on one retinal fundus image data set.}

  abstract = {Over the past few years, researchers have demonstrated the possibilities to use the Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) to provide a preliminary diagnosis. Recently, it is also becoming increasingly common for doctors and computer practitioners to collaborate on developing CAD. Since the early diagnosis of breast cancer is the most critical step, a precise segmentation of breast tumor with accurate edge and shape is vital for accurate diagnoses and reduction in the patients' pain. In view of the deficient accuracy of existing method, we proposed a novel method based on U-Net to improve the tumor segmentation accuracy in breast ultrasound images. First, Res Path was introduced into the U-Net to reduce the difference between the feature maps of the encoder and decoder. Then, a new connection, dense block from the input of the feature maps in the encoding-to-decoding section, was added to reduce the feature information loss and alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. A breast ultrasound database, which contains 538 tumor images, from Xinhua Hospital in Shanghai and marked by two professional doctors was used to train and test models. We, using ten-fold cross-validation method, compared the U-Net, U-Net with Res Path, and the proposed method to verify the improvements. The results demonstrated an overall improvement by the proposed approach when compared with the other in terms of true-positive rate, false-positive rate, Hausdorff distance indices, Jaccard similarity, and Dice coefficients.},
